# Zero-Hour-Challenge
Inspired by a challenge found in Destiny 2 (video game), this application solves maze challenges- set as row by column tiles- and shows the shortest path to the exit.

## Destiny 2 Zero Hour Inspiration
The Zero Hour set of mazes was designed by Coder Foundry to resemble the maze challenge found in the video game. In that challenge, the player had no way to tell which block was viable and which was not. They needed to navigate through the maze through trial and error to avoid traps and reach the other side.

While in game the tiles might look similar, the code shows that some tiles are set as "deadends" from the outset so that the program can then highlight the viable tiles from beginning to end.
